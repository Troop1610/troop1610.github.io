## About the Derby (2022)

Welcome to our second annual Lego Derby! Our Troop is excited to meet you and race against you. 
Our goal is to make new friends and have fun building and racing Lego Cars with our new friends. 
If you are interested, please sign up below by Friday, March 25th. 

<div style="border-color:#00cc00; border-style:double; border-width:thick; padding: 10px" markdown="1">

**Time**: Saturday, April 9, 2022 at 1:30pm (1pm if building a car on-site)<br/>
**Location**: Woodland West Church of Christ (Gym, East Side)<br />
3101 W. Park Row Dr, Arlington, TX

</div>

Everyone should plan to arrive at 1:30pm if their car is pre-built (or 
1pm if they plan to build a car on-site), with check-in cutoff at 1:45pm.  
Races will begin at 2pm.  We will race by age level, with the 
younger scouts going first.

Cost $10 per Girl Scout. Each scout will receive a pre-weighted Lego Derby Car Base, a fun 
patch celebrating this event, and a small selection of LEGOs you can use to decorate your car.
If you would like, you may also bring additional LEGOs from home.

Can't wait to see you there!

## Rules of the Road

These rules are similar to those found in most other derby races.  If you have ever 
participated in a pinewood derby or LEGO derby race before, you already have a good 
idea of what is goiing on.

### 1. Cars should be made by Girl Scouts in the current year.
Cars can be assembled ahead of time.  The size of the build plate is 6x16, and will be
provided in your kit that you will recieve in advance.  You are allowed to glue your pieces
on, if you desire; however, any glued pieces must be completely dry prior to final checkin
(1:45pm).

It is especially helpful to glue the baseplate to the weighted wheel piece, as that is
the most likely place for the car to "come apart."

### 2. Max width is 3 inches.
This includes all parts, including decorations.

Note, that cars should have a flat nose, so that they can rest behind the starting post. 
Cars with a pointed nose may find it difficult to sit behind the starting gate, and will 
be at a disadvantage when driving over the finish line sensor.

### 3. Max length is 7 inches.
This includes all parts, including decorations.

### 4. Max weight is 5 ounces.
This includes all parts, including decorations.

You can use any kinds of weights as long as they are firmly attached to the car.

Cars will be weighed using a digital scale with 1/20oz accuracy and calibrated using
a 5oz reference weight, but any digital scale or postage scale should yield 
reasonably accurate results. Come to check in prepared to tweak your car’s weight, 
if required. (The check-in scale is the final authority on car weight, no matter 
what your scale at home says.)

The following items will be provided to Scouts in advance:
- 2.2oz Wheel Kit
- 0.45oz 6x16 Nib Car Base
- extra LEGO pieces

Therefore, Scouts have _approximately_ 2.35oz to build with.

### 5. The car must have 3/8 inches clearance underneath the body.
This clearance is required to accomodate the finish line sensors which protrude
slightly from the bottom of the track.  This will not be a problem as long as 
no pieces are attached below the lowest point of the wheek kit.

### 5. The provided Wheel Kit and Car Base must be used.
Wheels may not be cut, drilled, beveled, or rounded.  No tools will be provided
on-site, nor will there be time for such modifications.

Minor imperfections or seams on the plastic wheels may be sanded down, if the 
Scout brings her own sand paper to do so.  (Keep in mind, there will be limited
time for car-building!)

All four wheels must be attached to the car.

### 6. Wheel bearings, washers, brushing, springs, liquid lubricant, loose materials (such a lead shot), and “starting devices” are prohibited.
The recommended lubricant is dry graphite powder.  No graphite powder will be provided,
so if a scout wants to use it on her axles, she should bring some.  Graphite powder
for derby cars can be purchased in advance from Amazon.
