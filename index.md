We are a Brownie-aged Girl Scout Troop in Arlington, TX based out of Jones Academy of Fine Arts and Dual Language.  Girl Scouts is a program for girls, by girls that promotes courage, confidence, and character in young girls.  For more information about the Girl Scouts program, contact [Girl Scouts Texas Oklahoma Plains](https://www.gs-top.org/en/our-council/web-to-case.html).  If you are a parent of one of our girls or if you have a question about our troop specifically, contact us at [leader@troop1610.org](mailto:leader@troop1610.org).
